## Project Reflection – Pirate Intelligent Agent

For this project, I implemented an intelligent pirate agent that learns to navigate a treasure maze using reinforcement learning. The starter code provided the environment setup, game logic, and basic maze configuration. I created and refined the agent’s learning algorithm, including its Q-learning structure, reward calculations, and exploration–exploitation balance. I also implemented functions for training over many episodes and evaluating how well the agent learned to find treasure efficiently.

Throughout this course, I learned how reinforcement learning fits into the broader field of computer science by demonstrating how autonomous systems can improve performance through feedback and experience. Computer scientists design these systems to solve real-world problems, from robotics and automation to recommendation engines. Their work matters because it drives innovation in how humans and technology interact and make decisions.

When approaching a problem as a computer scientist, I learned to break it into smaller parts, analyze the relationships between data and behavior, and apply systematic testing to refine the model. This process of iteration—testing, observing outcomes, and adjusting parameters—is essential in machine learning and in general software development.

Ethically, I recognize my responsibility to design systems that are transparent, fair, and aligned with user and organizational goals. For reinforcement learning and AI, that means considering how algorithms might affect users, ensuring data integrity, and preventing unintended harm caused by biased or opaque decision-making. Ultimately, the goal is to create technology that learns responsibly and benefits its users.
